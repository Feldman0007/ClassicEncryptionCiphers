To compile, simply, type ''make'' at the terminal (without the quotes).

Please do not forget to include a README file in your submission.
It's worth 5 points.

Your README file should include:

– Names and email addresses of all partners.
– The programming language you use (e.g. C++, Java, Python)
– How to execute your program.
– Whether you implemented the extra credit.
– Anything special about your submission that we should take note of.

In cipher interface - set the max_num_columns to a large size if the input is large, or my implementation won't work. 10,000 character input may need to be 5000
Also, in Railfence.h MAX_RAILS is used to initialized the rails array. Currently is set to 10 but if more than 10 rails are going to be used then change this value
If we run encryption on a plaintext, just for funsies, program will not work because I don't handle capitalization in decryption, I assume case was already stripped during encryption
